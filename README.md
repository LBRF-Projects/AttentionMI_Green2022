# Attention and Motor Imagery
-
This repository contains the experiment code for Green et al. (2022), a study exploring the relationship between how different measures of attention and working memory relate to motor imagery performance.

This study involves 4 different tasks: TraceLab ([see here](https://github.com/LBRF/TraceLab) for more information), the Hand Laterality Judgement Test (HLJT), a change detection task, and a computerized version of the Motor Imagery Questionnaire (MIQ).
